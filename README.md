# Libft - 42

libft is the most basic Project in the 42 curriculum. It aims to provide a basic set of tools for later projects.
The functions themselves are split between those which are commonly found in standard libraries, and more complex ones to challenge you.
The first category will provide a solid foundation and understanding for the basic concepts you will use later.
It is also encouraged to add any functions from future projects, as well as your own, should you deem them useful.

## Usage
Preferrably you will not ever need clone this repository as you are likely a 42 student and are writing your very own.
However, if you would like to take a peek at what others are doing, or what functions I added:

1. Clone the Repository
2. 
```
cd libft
make
```
The library file libft.a should have been created. You will only need this and the libft.h header file.  
3. When working on a project, add `#include "<filepath>libft.h"` to access the functions.  
4. When compiling, add libft.a. For example `cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra libft.a example.c`.  
You can store them anywhere, but will need the file path to them.  
You should now be good to go.
